## What is cpp-template
This is my go to C++ minimal template for my new projects in Linux. Some parts are inspired from Jason Turner's [cpp-starter-project](https://github.com/lefticus/cpp_starter_project). Feel free to fork it and tailor it as per your needs.

## Dependencies
- GCC or Clang with C++17 support
- CMake
- Conan
